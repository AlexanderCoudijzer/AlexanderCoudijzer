### Hi there, I'm Alexander

I'm currently studying for an MSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).
My MSc project is in household electricity load forecasting using neural networks.
I've got a keen interest in machine learning and neural networks in particular.

I'm open to working in any data science or machine learning engineering role.
