### Hi there, I'm Alexander

I've recently graduated from an MSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).
My MSc project was in household electricity load forecasting using neural networks.
I also hold an MSc in geology (hydrogeology and soil) and was working in seismic data processing as a geophyisicst for 11 years before starting my data science MSc.

I've got a keen interest in machine learning and neural networks in particular and I'm currently working on computer vision applications.
